== Description ==

Create your own layouts of blocks, and insert them anywhere, as a block (Gutenberg).

=== HOW IT WORKS ===

Reusable Blocks Layouts creates a new WordPress Post Type called Blocks (and *blocks-layout* internally in WordPress). Using it, you will be able to create new layouts made of Gutenberg blocks. Then, you will be able to re-use those layouts anywhere in your Gutenberg editor. The Layouts will be accessible through a Gutenberg block called *Blocks Layout*.
